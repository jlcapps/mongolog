mongolog

An example rails app, illustrating use of the central_logger gem on heroku.com.
To see it in action (there's not much to see) check out
http://morning-galaxy-180.heroku.com/.

To install:

1. Download this application from github. Bundle install to add dependencies
and do the usual dance to create a Heroku app.

2. *Remove* logging: heroku addons:remove logging:basic

3. *Add* mongohq: heroku addons:add mongohq:free

4. Restart: heroku restart

That's it. You can hit the mongolog app a couple of times and see the requests
logged using heroku console (as described in the central_logger README):

  >> db = Rails.logger.mongo_connection
  >> collection = db[Rails.logger.mongo_collection_name]
  >> c = collection.find(:all)
  >> c.count

So what else do you need to know? Not much. See config/central_logger.yml. And
add

  include CentralLogger::Filter

to ApplicationController. That's it.
